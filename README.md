# Vocab-build

Vocab-build is a tool created to study English vocabulary from the command-line.

With it, you can:
- Add a word of your choice
- Download the audio file of the pronunciation of a word
- Add words from another `csv` file (merge files)
- Play and test yourself with a quiz


The project has a `words.csv` file that contains 181 words and definitions, adapted from [sat-words by Scholars' Academy](https://github.com/scholarsnyc/sat-words). All the words you add are appended to this main file.
With the field names `word` and `definition`, the structure of the file simply looks like this:
```
word,definition
arrogate,to take without justification
imperious,"commanding, domineering"
umbrage,"resentment, offense"
cogent,intellectually convincing
...
```

Vocab-build uses the [Rich library](https://github.com/Textualize/rich) to style the display, and format the output on the terminal.

[Free Dictionary API](https://github.com/meetDeveloper/freeDictionaryAPI) is used for finding the definitions of words, as well as for finding the audio URL of a pronunciation.


### Install requirements:
```
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```


### The opening screen
If the program is run without any optional arguments (i.e., `python project.py`), the opening screen that is shown in the image below is displayed:

![The opening screen](./readme-images/opening_screen.jpg)

A "welcome" figlet (created with [pyfiglet](https://pypi.org/project/pyfiglet/)) is shown, followed by a table, informing the user of optional arguments to use to help them choose an action.

### Adding a word
To add a word, the optional argument `--word` or, `-w` is used, followed by a word of choice.

`python project.py -w [WORD]`

[Free Dictionary API](https://github.com/meetDeveloper/freeDictionaryAPI) is used to find the definition of the word. If the operation is successful, the word and its definition are added to the `words.csv` file. The definition is displayed on the terminal as well as a message informing the user that the operation is successful as such:

### Downloading the audio of the pronunciation of a word
To download the audio file of the pronunciation of a word, the optional argument `--sound` or, `-s` is used, followed by a word of choice.

`python project.py -s [WORD]`

Again, the [Free Dictionary API](https://github.com/meetDeveloper/freeDictionaryAPI) is used to find the URL path of the audio file. If it exists, a folder called `sounds` is created on the same path as the program, and a `[WORD].mp3` is created inside it. For example, if the command looks like this for the first time:

`python project.py -s arcane`

Then, the newly created folder structure will simply look like this:

```
sounds/
└── arcane.mp3
```

If the operation is successful, a success message will be displayed on the terminal.

### Adding words from another csv file (merging files)
To add multiple words from another `csv` file, the optional argument `--file` or, `-f` is used, followed by the path of the file to merge.

`python project.py -f [FILENAME].csv`

Note that the file has to have a similar structure to the `words.csv`, except the headers are not necessary.
If the operation is successful, the new words are added to `words.csv`, and a success message is displayed on the terminal.

### Play / quiz
With the option `--play` or, `-p`, the user can play a "quiz game" where they are asked to find the correct definitions of words.

`python project.py -p`

A random word from the `words.csv` file and four definitions (one of them being the correct one, and the rest being randomly chosen) are displayed.

![A word and four definitions displayed](./readme-images/play_n.jpg)


The user enters the number of the definition they choose, and if it is correct, a success message is displayed before continuing to the next question.

![Correct answer](./readme-images/play_c.jpg)

If the user gives the wrong answer, an informing message as well as the correct answer is displayed before continuing to the next question.

![Wrong answer](./readme-images/play_w.jpg)

The game continues until the user chooses to exit the game.

### The file structure
The project consists of four Python files, one of them being the test file, as well as the `words.csv` file for the main vocabulary list, `requirements.txt` for the packages used, and a `README.md` with the folder that has the images used in this file.
- `project.py` is the main file that contains the `main` function itself, it also contains functionality of adding arguments, adding/getting words to/from `words.csv`, and handling the requests for getting definitions and the audio path.
- `style_screen.py` handles the functionality of styling the terminal, such as creating a welcome figlet, creating panels, organizing the layout, and formatting the output.
- `helpers.py` contains some helper functions such as creating the sounds folder and the mp3 file, resolving file path, getting random definitions, and handling user answers related to the "play" option.
- `test_project.py` contains ten tests for all the functions in `project.py` as well as two functions in `style_screen.py`.
- `words.csv` is the main file containing all the words and definitions.

### Requirements
The project requires the following packages:
- pyfiglet==0.8.post1
- requests==2.28.1
- rich==12.5.1

For testing:
- pytest==7.2.0
